MacAssistant RT is a scout utility / real time editor application for Football Manager and OS X 10.7+

**News 19/06/2014:**
I have already started work on MacAssistant RT15 which will also be a big update for the 2014 edition. You can see screenshots and give feedback on MacAssistant's Facebook page! It is going to be a massive update unlike any one you've seen so far! Some cool new features will include shortlist editing/importing/exporting, Club kit & colour editing and so much more! Go to MacAssistant RT's facebook page to find out all about the new features and also request what you'd like to see in the new version!

MacAssistant RT is a real time scout tool / real time editor for Football Manager 2014. It supports Mac OS X 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 and the latest 14.3.1 Steam version of FM2014. It's also backwards compatible with Football Manager 2013.
Exclusively available from fmscout.com

Picking up where MacAssistant RT for FM13 left off, the work continues on MacAssistant RT for FM14.

And for the first time, MacAssistant RT supports editing of club finances and player stats, CA/PA, Reputation and condition! This is an exclusive donator feature, so if you've donated in the past you should have received your license by now! If you haven't and want to edit your finances, a simple donation of any* amount will give you full unrestricted access to this year's MacAssistant RT Supporter features, and you'll receive your license within 24 hours! Scout functionality is still, and will remain free, for as long as I develop MacAssistant RT.
